# Localization

The IOTA community is very large and diverse. In order to achieve widespread adoption, it is important that users can use IOTA in their native language. To make localization easier, we use the i18next and react-i18next localization libraries. 

If you are making a contribution that includes text, please follow the instructions for localization. 

## Instructions

1. Import the `translate` higher order component (HOC)
```
import { translate } from ‘react-i18next’;
```

2. Set a constant `t` equal to the props
```
const { t } = this.props;
```

3. Tell i18next to get the translations for your keys (please name the key appropriately)
```
<Text>Hello world!</Text>
```
changes to
```
<Text>{t(‘helloWorld’)}</Text>
```

4. Export the translations
```
export translate(‘myContainer’)(MyContainer);
```

5. Update the JSON (located in `src/shared/locales/en/translation.json`) accordingly
```
“myContainer”:{
    “helloWorld”: “Hello world!”
}
```
