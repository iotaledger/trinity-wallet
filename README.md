## Branches

To create a new feature or bugfix (or chore) please create a new branch and use a prefix (e.g `feature/my-awesome-new-feature` or `bugfix/something-not-working`). The prefixes we use are `bug`, `feat`, `chore` and `hotfix`. Please don't use anything else.

If you are adding any text in your work, please follow the instructions in [localisation.md](https://github.com/iotaledger/trinity-wallet/blob/develop/docs/dev/localisation.md). 

When creating a new branch try to always branch off from `develop`. Avoid branching off from other branches unless it's absolutely necessary.

When you're done with your work create a new Pull Request and use your branch as **source** branch and **develop** as target branch. Never create Pull Requests directly against **master** as target branch unless you're trying to merge an important hotfix.
