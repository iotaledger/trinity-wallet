# IOTA Trinity Desktop Wallet

This is the repository for the IOTA Trinity Desktop Wallet. The application is based on [React](https://reactjs.org) and built on [Electron](https://electronjs.org/). 

## Building the application

To build the application locally from source, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Node.JS and Electron
First you need to install Node.JS if you havenâ€™t done that already.
Then run the following command to install electron globally.
```
yarn global add electron
```

### 2. Clone or download the Trinity repo from GitLab.
Clone the GitLab repo by running this command:
```
git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/trinity-wallet.git
```

After cloning or downloading and extracting the application run:
```
cd trinity-wallet
```
### 3. Install dependencies
Now we need to install dependencies, such as the electron installer or the React code packager. Do this by running:
```
yarn full-setup
```
### 4. Build Trinity desktop appplication
When the yarn install is done you can build the wallet application by running:
```
yarn compile:mac
```
Change `mac` to your operating system - `mac`, `win` or `linux`.

This will start the building process for the Trinity Desktop application and could take a couple of minutes to finish.

After the building is finished, the application executable and installation files will be located in the directory `src/desktop/out/`.

### 4. Run Trinity desktop app in development mode
To start the application in development mode, run
```
yarn start
```

Note: you might have to rebuild the `keytar` node module under Windows with `.\node_modules\.bin\electron-builder install-app-deps`
as there's a bug with it ([link](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar/issues/51)).

## Trinity UI styleguide

To start the browser based UI styleguide and theme editor, run 
```
yarn styleguide
```
After the command finished to load, open `http://localhost:1074` in a browser. Chrome is preferred as it's used in the Trinity application itself.
