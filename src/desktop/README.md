This is the repository for the IOTA Trinity Desktop Wallet. The application is based on [React](https://reactjs.org) and built on [Electron](https://electronjs.org/).

## Required Dependencies

*   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (_Recommended version - 10.15.3_)
*   NPM (automatically installed with NodeJS)

On **Windows** platforms you'll need to install build tools to compile native modules:

```
# Install Visual C++ Build Tools and Python 2.7
npm install --global windows-build-tools

# Install OpenSSL VC++ Static 64bit Library
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg C:\src\vcpkg
cd C:\src\vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
.\vcpkg install openssl:x64-windows-static
```
Additionally on **Windows 7** install [.NET Framework 4.5.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40773)

On **Linux** platforms you'll need to install additional packages to compile native modules:

```
sudo apt install build-essential libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0 libusb-1.0-0-dev
sudo apt install gcc-4.8 g++-4.8 && export CXX=g++-4.8

# Fedora only:
yum install libusbx-devel
```

### 1. Installing dependencies

After installing the [shared dependencies](https://github.com/iotaledger/trinity-wallet#installation), install the desktop dependencies:

```
npm run deps:desktop
```

Then, navigate to this directory:

```
cd src/desktop
```

### 2. Prepare Trinity desktop appplication

When the npm install is done you can prepare the wallet application for compilation by running:

```
npm run build
```

Then, you can either compile a production version (3a) or development version (3b) of Trinity:

### 3a. Compile Trinity desktop appplication

After the application is prepared you can compile the wallet application by running:

```
npm run compile:mac
```

Change `mac` to your operating system - `mac`, `win` or `linux`.

This will start the building process for the Trinity Desktop application and could take a couple of minutes to finish.

After the building is finished, the application executable and installation files will be located in the directory `src/desktop/out/`.

### 3b. Run Trinity desktop app in development mode

To start the application in development mode, run

```
npm start
```

The application window will open automatically once the build is ready.

## Development mode troubleshooting

#### Wallet does not start after updating codebase to newer version

*   First, try to reinstall dependencies by running `npm install` and build the walelt again with `npm run build` as, most probably, the wallet dependencies have been updated and the configuration has changed.

*   Development environment does not clear user configuration files after switching between different Trinity versions. You have to do it manually by removing the directory yourself:

```
# On macOS
rm -rf ~/Library/Application Support/Electron

# On Windows
Remove-Item –path %APPDATA%/Electron –recurse

# On Linux
rm -rf ~/.config/Electron
```

#### Wallet starts with a blank screen

*   Try to reload the application with _ctrl+r_ (_cmd+r_ on macOS) while the `Developer tools` window is focused
*   Check `Developer tools` console for any errors - try to fix them or report at [Trinity issues](https://github.com/iotaledger/trinity-wallet/issues)
