This App Privacy Policy is dedicated to users of the Trinity Wallet App. If you would like to know more about how IOTA Foundation processes Personal Data (as defined below) collected and processed in connection with other services and activities of IOTA Foundation, please see IOTA Foundation&#39;s general [Privacy Policy](https://www.iota.org/research/privacy-policy).

Please read our App Privacy Policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we handle your Personal Data when collected through the Trinity Wallet App.

### **What is Personal Data**

&quot; **Personal Data**&quot; means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (&#39;data subject&#39;); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

### **How we collect Personal Data**

If you install and use the Trinity Wallet App on your phone, the IOTA Foundation may collect and process Personal Data required for the operation of the App and management and fulfilment of the App services.

Further, the IOTA Foundation may collect and process Personal Data like your email address or phone number when:

- you provide such Personal Data to IOTA Foundation to enable email notifications or
- you contact IOTA Foundation, or request that IOTA Foundation contacts you, for any reason, or
- you submit your Personal Data to IOTA Foundation for any reason.

If you enable email notifications, IOTA Foundation could store your email address on its servers.

### **Which Personal Data do we collect**

It is crucial to note that private keys of the users are never transmitted to the IOTA Foundation, so it is not possible for the IOTA Foundation to access a user&#39;s crypto assets in any case.

The IOTA Foundation keeps access logs to our servers, which may contain IP address, time and access details.

We may collect information relating to the general use of the Trinity Wallet App such as errors, log information concerning any errors encountered in the Trinity Wallet App and other related information relevant to IOTA Foundation&#39;s provision of the services, for the purpose of administration and error analysis to help IOTA Foundation improve its services.

### **Purpose of processing of Personal Data**

We process the Personal Data in order to enable the operation and use of the Trinity Wallet App as well as for the administration and management of the Trinity Wallet App and the services offered via it.

  - the processing is required by applicable law;

### **How we share and disclose Personal Data**

In order to properly operate the Trinity Wallet App and to be able to provide you the services offered via the Trinity Wallet App, we use the following analytics software:

Further information you can find under http://docs.bugsnag.com/legal/privacy-policy.

**Data Processors**

When we are involving data processors into the performance of our services and contractual obligations and such involvement requires the sharing of Personal Data, we have entered with the data processors into data processing agreements according to Art. 28 of the European General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 ( **&quot;GDPR&quot;** ) and, as far as required, further appropriate safeguards according to Art. 46-49 GDPR.

### **Consequences in case we may not collect your Personal Data**

We need your Personal Data to enable your use of the Trinity Wallet App and to provide you with the services offered via the Trinity Wallet App in order to perform our contractual obligations towards you. Without providing such Personal Data, we may not be able to provide you the services you are intending to receive.

### **Consent and withdrawal**

Any consent is provided freely. If you give your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. After your withdrawal we will stop processing your Personal Data, including storage, unless further data processing is required and legally permitted. This paragraph is only relevant for processing that is entirely voluntary – it does not apply for processing that is necessary or obligatory in any way, as is for example the case with regard to Personal Data required for the installation and the operation of the Trinity Wallet App.
