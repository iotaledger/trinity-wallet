## **Conditions of Use for the Trinity Wallet App**

These conditions of use (the &quot; **Conditions**&quot;) apply to the &quot; **Trinity Wallet App**&quot;, which is available from app stores and provided by the IOTA Foundation Strassburgerstr. 55, 10405 Berlin, as long as and in as far as no other agreements have been reached with the customer (the **&quot;user&quot;** ).

BY REGISTERING IN THE APP, YOU DECLARE THAT YOU AGREE TO THESE CONDITIONS.

### **1. General**

1. The application (hereinafter referred to as **&quot;app&quot;** or **&quot;Trinity Wallet App&quot;** for short) is offered by the IOTA Foundation (hereinafter referred to as **&quot;IOTA Foundation&quot;** or **&quot;we&quot;** for short) and enables access to the user&#39;s respective E-Wallet.

2. The Trinity Wallet App is a piece of software. The Trinity Wallet App is not an account whereby the IOTA Foundation or other third parties act as financial intermediaries or safekeepers of the users&#39; cryptocurrencies.

3. The IOTA Foundation acts, in association with the Trinity Wallet App, as a software provider and is not a crypto-exchange or a place for buying or selling cryptocurrencies, and it is not another form of payment service in terms of § 1 of the German Payment Services Supervision Act. The app solely enables the user to access their respective E-Wallet by mobile telephone or other mobile or desktop device.

4. Although our software for the Trinity Wallet App has been subjected to a Beta-test and has been further improved using feedback from respected developers, we cannot guarantee that the software is entirely free of errors. You acknowledge that you shall be using this software at your own risk and in compliance with all valid laws. You are responsible for keeping safe your passwords, private key pairs, PINs and other codes you use for access to the software.

5. We do not have any control over goods and services which are paid for using the app, we do not accept any liability for this, and we are not responsible for the successful completion of business transactions between buyers and sellers. There is a risk, therefore, that you are dealing with minors or persons using a false name.

6. The IOTA Foundation cannot retrieve your private codes or passwords if you have lost them or forgotten them, and it cannot guarantee a transaction confirmation because the IOTA Foundation does not have any control over the user&#39;s respective E-Wallet.

7. You are not allowed to transfer or surrender any rights or duties from these conditions without prior written permission from the IOTA Foundation. You are not permitted to transfer your Wallet to a third party. The IOTA Foundation reserves the right to transfer or surrender contractual relationships or rights and duties resulting from contractual relationships with you, without your prior permission. This does not affect your right to close the Wallet.

8. IOTA tokens are a so-called alternative cryptocurrency.

9. Amendments to these conditions shall be offered to you in text form (e.g. by e-mail) at least 2 months before the suggested time of taking effect. Your agreement counts as given if you do not object before the suggested time of the changes taking effect. If you do not agree to the changes, you can terminate without notice and free of charge before the suggested time of the change taking effect. In the message in which we offer the changes, we will specifically point out once again your right to objection, the deadline and your cancellation option. We will also publish the amended conditions on the Trinity Wallet App website.
If we are only introducing a new service or a new function or making changes that do not negatively affect your rights or duties, we are entitled to announce them with a notice period of just one month. The appeal deadline is 3 weeks.

10. You also declare that you agree to the provision of any updates for the Trinity Wallet App and realise that failure to update can result in a security risk or even loss of your IOTA tokens.

11. The General Terms and Conditions of Business of the app store must be observed in addition to these conditions to procure the app or download it from Apple Stores.

5. You guarantee that you do not use our services or will immediately stop use if the valid law in your country prohibits use;

6. You guarantee that you will not use our services or will immediately stop use if you are located, or become located at any time, in a state or region where trading with IOTA tokens is prohibited or requires authorisation, special authorisation and/or authorisation of any kind, which the IOTA Foundation and/or you has/have not obtained in this state or region; and
