## Account Syncing

The application makes sure that it syncs account information with the tangle at regular intervals, especially before critical actions (making a transfer).

### Initial Syncing

The application begins generating addresses from the user's seed in bulk (default of ten). For each set of addresses it communicates with the ledger
to see if there are any transaction hashes associated with those addresses. This process (address generation and checking for associated transaction hashes) is repeated until no address in the set has any associated transaction hash on the tangle.

> **Note:** On initial sync Trinity keeps a single unused address to be used as the receiving address.

After having all the addresses (with transfers) generated, the application constructs all transfer bundles from the hashes. 

> **Note:** For confirmed transfers, the application makes sure that it does not add reattachments and only stores a single bundle.
 
 All bundles are validated before adding to the local application state.

### Manual Syncing

Manual syncing forces clean up of the existing account state, bringing in all the account information from tangle.
It follows the exact same steps as (Initial Sync)(#initial-syncing). The currently-selected local account state is removed and replaced with the new state from the tangle.

### Auto Syncing

Auto syncing is a service that runs in the background, making sure that the wallet is always up-to-date with the latest state on the tangle.

It is built to be as lightweight as possible. It always updates the local application state whenever it detects a difference between local account state and the tangle state.

The service is responsible for:

- Checking unspent addresses and adding new valid bundles to state when found on the tangle.
- Checking latest balance on all the addresses stored on the device.
- Checking unspent addresses stored on device in case they have been spent from on some other device. 
- Checking validity of unconfirmed bundles. In case a bundle is no longer valid, the application would stop promoting it.

## Promotions

The application keeps track of all pending value transfers and automatically promotes them in the background.

> **Note:** The application does not promote zero value and invalid pending transfers.

Unlike the syncing service which only works for the currently selected account, the promotion service works for all added accounts.

The application keeps track of all the valid unconfirmed transactions and promotes them in a sequential manner, until confirmed.

> **Note** The way promotion works, it cannot always promote a valid transaction. One of the reasons being in case a transaction has gone below maximum depth in the tangle. The application will detect if none of the reattachments or the original transaction can be promoted, and will automatically make a new reattachment to the tangle and promotes that specific reattachment.

## Transfers

### Zero Value Transfers

The application offers a feature to send zero value transfers to addresses.

This feature allows exchanging messages. Inputs are not signed for zero value transfers so no prior checking on address reuse is performed when a user tries to make a zero value transfer.
Since zero value transfers have just outputs and no inputs, the bundle would not have any address from the sender's seed. 
This leads to a problem where initial sync and manual sync fail to detect these transfers on the tangle (since they do not have any address information from the sender).
To overcome this issue, the application always adds a new transfer object to the bundle containing the first address of the sender.    

> **Note:** There are no pre-requisite checks performed before making zero value transfers (Forcing account sync, checking if the receiving address is already spent from).

### Value Transfers

Value transfers pass through a series of validations before the input signing process and broadcasting.

The application would not allow a transfer 
- If the receiving address is already spent from.
- If addresses with balance (used in inputs) have pending incoming transfers.
- If addresses with balance (used in inputs) are already spent from.

> **Note:** The application performs auto syncing at regular intervals, but before making a transfer, it is made sure that the account and addresses are synced with the tangle.

### Input Management

The application manages inputs by using locally stored addresses and does not rely on the tangle directly.
However, the application makes sure it syncs the account before selecting addresses for inputs.

Input management starts with the **first** address with balance.
It is also made sure that the addresses chosen for inputs were not previously spent from by communicating with the tangle.

## Polling

The application polls for a set of services when the app is in foreground.

The polling services are: 

- Promotion
- Market information
- Price information
- Latest currency conversion rates
- Account information

Polling is designed in a way that only a single service becomes active at a time. If any service fails, it would retry thrice before passing control to the next service. 

> **Note:** Promotion should always become active after the account information is fully synced. 
On login, the application makes sure the account is synced, so on successful login promotion would be the first service that becomes active.
